AI Writing Style Scanner

This AI Writing Style Scanner is an attempt to create a standalone detector for AI influence in academic, business, or casual writing.  The project uses a variety of tests to analyze the provided text and estimate the likelihood that the text was generated by an AI LLM.

The project was inspired by this research: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adt3813

Installation:
Simply upload this project to an empty folder on your webserver.

Dependencies:
The only optional dependency is the pdftotext package from poppler-utils.  If your server has it available, this project can analyze PDF documents.  If it does not find the package, then it will only provide a textbox for input.
